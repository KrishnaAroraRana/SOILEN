1. **What is a programming language?**
   A programming language is a formal set of instructions used to communicate with a computer and create software programs.

2. **What is a compiler?**
   A compiler is a software tool that translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code executable by a computer.

3. **What is an interpreter?**
   An interpreter is a program that executes code line by line, converting high-level programming language into machine code at runtime.

4. **What is an algorithm?**
   An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task, often used in programming and computer science.

5. **What is a variable?**
   A variable is a named storage location in a program that can hold different values during the program's execution.

6. **What is a data type?**
   A data type defines the kind of data a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or strings.

7. **What is a function?**
   A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task, which can be called and reused multiple times within a program.

8. **What is a loop?**
   A loop is a programming construct that repeats a block of code while a certain condition is true, such as a "for" or "while" loop.

9. **What is a conditional statement?**
   A conditional statement, such as an "if" statement, allows a program to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false.

10. **What is debugging?**
    Debugging is the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing errors or bugs in a program to ensure it runs correctly.

11. **What is pseudocode?**
    Pseudocode is a simplified, human-readable description of an algorithm or program, using plain language and basic programming constructs.

12. **What is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)?**
    An IDE is a software application that provides tools and features for writing, testing, and debugging code, such as Visual Studio or Eclipse.

13. **What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?**
    OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to organize and structure code, promoting modularity and reuse.

14. **What is a class in OOP?**
    A class is a blueprint for creating objects in OOP, defining the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) of the objects.

15. **What is inheritance in OOP?**
    Inheritance is an OOP concept where a new class (subclass) inherits properties and methods from an existing class (superclass).

16. **What is encapsulation in OOP?**
    Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods within a class and restricting direct access to some of the class's components.

17. **What is polymorphism in OOP?**
    Polymorphism is an OOP concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling a single interface to represent different underlying forms.

18. **What is abstraction in OOP?**
    Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object or system.

19. **What is a software development lifecycle (SDLC)?**
    The SDLC is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying software, typically involving stages such as requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

20. **What is pair programming?**
    Pair programming is a collaborative programming technique where two programmers work together at one workstation, with one writing code (the driver) and the other reviewing it (the navigator).



1. **What is syntax in programming?**
   Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the structure and format of statements in a programming language.

2. **What is a code editor?**
   A code editor is a tool that provides features for writing and editing code, often with syntax highlighting and auto-completion.

3. **What is a loop iteration?**
   A loop iteration is a single execution of the loop body, performed once for each element or condition.

4. **What is a code block?**
   A code block is a group of statements enclosed within curly braces `{}` or other delimiters, executed as a unit.

5. **What is a logical operator?**
   A logical operator is used in programming to perform logical operations, such as AND (`&&`), OR (`||`), and NOT (`!`).

6. **What is a function parameter?**
   A function parameter is a variable defined in the function signature that receives values passed to the function.

7. **What is a return statement?**
   A return statement is used in a function to return a value to the caller and exit the function.

8. **What is recursion?**
   Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems.

9. **What is a pointer?**
   A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable, commonly used in languages like C and C++.

10. **What is a library?**
    A library is a collection of pre-written code and functions that can be used by programmers to perform common tasks.

11. **What is debugging?**
    Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in a program to ensure correct and efficient operation.

12. **What is a breakpoint?**
    A breakpoint is a tool used in debugging to pause program execution at a specific point, allowing inspection of code and variables.

13. **What is a comment in programming?**
    A comment is a non-executable line in the code used to provide explanations or notes for developers, often marked by `//` or `/* */`.

14. **What is an array?**
    An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same type, accessible by index.

15. **What is a linked list?**
    A linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node.

16. **What is a binary search?**
    A binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

17. **What is dynamic programming?**
    Dynamic programming is a problem-solving approach that solves complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the results.

18. **What is a hash table?**
    A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, allowing fast data retrieval through hash functions.

19. **What is a stack data structure?**
    A stack is a data structure that follows a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order, where the last element added is the first to be removed.

20. **What is a queue data structure?**
    A queue is a data structure that follows a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order, where the first element added is the first to be removed.
