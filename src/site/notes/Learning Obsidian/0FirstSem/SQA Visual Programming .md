### **Block-Based Programming**  
**Q1:** What is a **Block** in Scratch?  
**A1:** A block is a visual code snippet in Scratch that represents a specific action (e.g., motion, sound, or control). Blocks snap together to create scripts.  

**Q2:** How does a **Sequence** affect program execution?  
**A2:** A sequence determines the order in which blocks execute, ensuring actions happen step-by-step.  

---

### **Program Structure**  
**Q3:** What is the purpose of a **Custom Block**?  
**A3:** Custom blocks allow users to create reusable code segments, simplifying complex scripts and reducing repetition.  

**Q4:** How do **Parameters** enhance a custom block?  
**A4:** Parameters let users pass values (e.g., numbers or text) into a custom block, making it adaptable for different scenarios.  

---

### **Control Structures**  
**Q5:** What is the difference between a **Loop** (e.g., `repeat`) and a **Forever** block?  
**A5:** A `repeat` loop runs code a set number of times, while `forever` runs code continuously until manually stopped.  

**Q6:** How does **Event Handling** work in Scratch?  
**A6:** Event handling uses blocks like `when green flag clicked` or `when key pressed` to trigger scripts based on user actions or conditions.  

---

### **Data Management**  
**Q7:** How is a **Variable** used to track a game score?  
**A7:** A variable stores numerical data (e.g., `score`) that increases/decreases based on in-game events (e.g., collecting items).  

**Q8:** What is a **List** in Scratch?  
**A8:** A list stores multiple related values (e.g., high scores or inventory items) in a single structure.  

---

### **Animation Basics**  
**Q9:** How does a **Sprite** differ from a **Backdrop**?  
**A9:** A sprite is a movable character/object, while a backdrop is the static background image of the stage.  

**Q10:** What does the **Motion** block `glide to x: y:` do?  
**A10:** It smoothly moves a sprite to specific coordinates over a set time, creating fluid animation.  

---

### **Game Mechanics**  
**Q11:** How do you create **Interaction** between sprites?  
**A11:** Use blocks like `broadcast` and `when I receive` to send messages between sprites, triggering coordinated actions.  

**Q12:** Explain how to add a **Sound** effect when a sprite is clicked.  
**A12:** Attach a `when this sprite clicked` event block to a `play sound` block.  

---

---

### **Block-Based Programming**  
**Q21:** What is the difference between a **Hat Block** and a **Stack Block**?  
**A21:** A *Hat Block* (e.g., `when green flag clicked`) starts scripts based on events, while a *Stack Block* (e.g., `move 10 steps`) performs actions and snaps below other blocks.  

**Q22:** How do **Broadcast** and **Broadcast and Wait** differ?  
**A22:** `Broadcast` sends a message to trigger other scripts immediately, while `Broadcast and Wait` pauses the current script until the triggered scripts finish.  

---

### **Program Structure**  
**Q23:** How can you use **Multiple Sprites** to organize code?  
**A23:** Assign specific roles to sprites (e.g., one for movement, another for scoring) to keep scripts modular and easier to debug.  

**Q24:** Give an example of an **Event Block** that responds to user input.  
**A24:** `When [space] key pressed` or `When this sprite clicked` are event blocks that trigger scripts based on user actions.  

---

### **Control Structures**  
**Q25:** How would you use a **Conditional Statement** to detect a sprite collision?  
**A25:** Use the `if <> then` block with the `touching [sprite]?` sensing block to trigger actions on collision.  

**Q26:** How can you **Stop a Loop** prematurely in Scratch?  
**A26:** Use the `stop [this script]` block inside a conditional statement within the loop to exit early.  

---

### **Data Management**  
**Q27:** What is a **Cloud Variable**, and how is it unique?  
**A27:** Cloud variables (marked with ☁) store data online, allowing real-time updates across users’ projects (e.g., global high scores).  

**Q28:** How would you use a **List** to create an inventory system?  
**A28:** Store item names in a list (e.g., `inventory`) and use `add [item]` or `delete` blocks to manage items dynamically.  

---

### **Animation Basics**  
**Q29:** How do **Costumes** create animation effects for a sprite?  
**A29:** Switching between costumes rapidly (using `next costume` in a loop) simulates animation, like a walking character.  

**Q30:** What does the `go to front layer` block do?  
**A30:** It brings a sprite to the top layer of the stage, ensuring it’s visible over other sprites.  

---

### **Game Mechanics**  
**Q31:** How would you code a **Timer** for a game?  
**A31:** Create a variable `timer`, reset it to 0, and use a `forever` loop with `change timer by 1` and `wait 1 second` blocks.  

**Q32:** Explain how to detect **Winning/Losing Conditions** in a maze game.  
**A32:** Use `if` blocks to check if the sprite `touching [color]?` (e.g., exit color for win, red for lose).  

---

### **Problem-Solving**  
**Q33:** How do you troubleshoot a script that runs too slowly?  
**A33:** Simplify loops, reduce unnecessary blocks, or use `stop other scripts in sprite` to optimize performance.  

**Q34:** What is a common error when using **Clones**, and how do you fix it?  
**A34:** Clones not deleting properly can cause lag. Always include `delete this clone` when their task is done.  

---

**Q42:** What is the purpose of the **Pen Extension**?  
**A42:** The Pen tools let sprites draw lines/shapes on the stage, useful for creating art, graphs, or trail effects.  

 

---

### **Advanced Animation**  
**Q43:** How can you simulate **gravity** in a Scratch jumping game?  
**A43:** Use a variable `gravity` that decreases a sprite’s `y` position gradually, combined with a `jump` variable to propel it upward.  

**Q44:** What is **parallax scrolling**, and how would you code it?  
**A44:** Parallax scrolling creates depth by moving backdrops at different speeds. Use multiple sprites with layered backgrounds and loops to adjust their `x` positions.  

---

### **Game Design**  
**Q45:** How do you program a **power-up system** (e.g., speed boost)?  
**A45:** Use variables (e.g., `speed`) and conditional statements to detect power-up collection (e.g., `if touching [power-up] then change speed by 2`).  

**Q46:** How would you design a **multi-level game** in Scratch?  
**A46:** Use a `level` variable and `switch backdrop to [level 2]` blocks, with `if` statements to trigger new enemy spawns or challenges.  

---

### **User Input & Interaction**  
**Q47:** How can a user **type their name** into a Scratch game?  
**A47:** Use the `ask [What’s your name?] and wait` block, then store the answer in a variable like `player_name`.  

**Q48:** How do you create a **drag-and-drop puzzle** game?  
**A48:** Use `when this sprite clicked` and `go to [mouse-pointer]` blocks to let users drag sprites, and `if touching [target]` to detect correct placement.  

---

### **Advanced Data**  
**Q49:** How would you use **binary or hexadecimal** numbers in Scratch?  
**A49:** Convert numbers using custom blocks or lists (e.g., store binary digits in a list and update them with division/modulo operations).  

**Q50:** How can you save **game progress** without cloud variables?  
**A50:** Encode progress (e.g., level, score) into a string variable and let users copy it to reload later (e.g., "level3-score250").  

---

### **Cross-Disciplinary Projects**  
**Q51:** How can Scratch model a **scientific concept** like photosynthesis?  
**A51:** Use sprites for sunlight, water, and plants, with variables tracking "energy" and conditional statements triggering growth animations.  

**Q52:** Design a **math quiz** with randomized questions.  
**A52:** Use operators (`pick random`) to generate numbers, `ask` blocks for user answers, and variables to track correct responses.  

---

### **Troubleshooting & Optimization**  
**Q53:** Why does a sprite sometimes "glitch" through walls? How to fix it?  
**A53:** This happens due to fast movement. Use smaller steps in loops or check for collisions *before* moving (`if not touching [wall] then move`).  

**Q54:** How do you reduce **lag** in a project with many clones?  
**A54:** Limit clone numbers, use `hide` instead of `delete` for reusable objects, or simplify costume/backdrop details.  

---

### **Creative Extensions**
