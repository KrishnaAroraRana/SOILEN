1. **What is computer architecture?**
   Computer architecture refers to the design and organization of a computer's components and systems, focusing on the functionality, performance, and efficiency of the hardware and software.

2. **What is the CPU?**
   The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that executes instructions from programs by performing arithmetic, logical, control, and input/output operations.

3. **What is a microprocessor?**
   A microprocessor is an integrated circuit that contains the functions of a central processing unit (CPU) on a single chip, used in computers and other digital devices.

4. **What is a bus?**
   A bus is a communication system that transfers data between computer components, such as the CPU, memory, and input/output devices.

5. **What are registers?**
   Registers are small, fast storage locations within the CPU used to hold temporary data and instructions during processing.

6. **What is an instruction set architecture (ISA)?**
   An instruction set architecture (ISA) is the part of the computer architecture that defines the set of instructions that the CPU can execute.

7. **What is pipelining?**
   Pipelining is a technique used in CPU design to increase instruction throughput by overlapping the execution of multiple instructions.

8. **What is a cache?**
   A cache is a small, fast memory storage area that holds frequently accessed data to speed up processing.

9. **What is memory hierarchy?**
   Memory hierarchy is the organization of different types of memory (registers, cache, RAM, and storage) in a computer system based on speed, cost, and size.

10. **What is an ALU?**
    The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a component of the CPU that performs arithmetic and logical operations on data.

11. **What is a control unit?**
    The control unit is a part of the CPU that manages the execution of instructions by directing the operation of the ALU, memory, and input/output devices.

12. **What is a motherboard?**
    The motherboard is the main circuit board of a computer that connects and allows communication between the CPU, memory, and other hardware components.

13. **What is an interrupt?**
    An interrupt is a signal that temporarily halts the CPU's current operations to attend to a higher-priority task or event.

14. **What is parallel processing?**
    Parallel processing is the simultaneous execution of multiple instructions or tasks to improve computing performance and speed.

15. **What is a multicore processor?**
    A multicore processor is a single chip that contains two or more independent processing units (cores) that can execute instructions simultaneously.

16. **What is an input/output (I/O) system?**
    An input/output (I/O) system is a subsystem of a computer that manages communication between the CPU and external devices, such as keyboards, printers, and storage devices.

17. **What is memory addressing?**
    Memory addressing is the process of assigning and accessing specific memory locations in a computer system.

18. **What is a stack?**
    A stack is a data structure used in computer memory to store and manage data in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.

19. **What is virtual memory?**
    Virtual memory is a memory management technique that uses a portion of the hard drive as an extension of RAM to increase the available memory for programs.

20. **What is a system bus?**
    A system bus is a set of parallel wires that connect the CPU, memory, and input/output devices, allowing data transfer between them. 
    
    
21. What is cache memory? 

Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory that stores frequently accessed data and instructions to speed up retrieval. 

 

22. **What are cache lines?**
    Cache lines are the units of data transfer between the main memory and the cache, containing a fixed number of bytes.

23. **What is cache coherence?**
    Cache coherence refers to the consistency of data stored in multiple caches within a multi-processor system, ensuring all caches reflect the most recent write.

24. **What is Direct Memory Access (DMA)?**
    DMA allows peripherals to access main memory directly without CPU intervention, increasing data transfer speed and efficiency.

25. **What is an interrupt?**
    An interrupt is a signal to the CPU that requires immediate attention, temporarily halting the current execution to address the interrupt.

26. **What is an interrupt handler?**
    An interrupt handler (or interrupt service routine) is a software routine that is executed in response to an interrupt, managing the specific event.

27. **What is a Memory Management Unit (MMU)?**
    The MMU is a hardware component responsible for handling memory access and translating virtual addresses to physical addresses.

28. **What is virtual memory?**
    Virtual memory is a memory management technique that uses hard disk space as an extension of RAM, allowing programs to use more memory than physically available.

29. **What is paging?**
    Paging is a memory management scheme that divides memory into fixed-size blocks called pages, facilitating virtual memory.

30. **What is segmentation?**
    Segmentation is a memory management scheme that divides memory into variable-size blocks called segments, each with a logical function.

31. **What is a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)?**
    A TLB is a cache for the MMU that stores recent virtual-to-physical address translations, speeding up memory access.

32. **What is bus width?**
    Bus width refers to the number of bits that can be transmitted simultaneously over a bus, affecting data transfer rates.

33. **What is bus clock speed?**
    Bus clock speed determines the rate at which data can be transferred over a bus, measured in Hertz (Hz).

34. **What is a chipset?**
    A chipset is a group of integrated circuits designed to work together, controlling communication between the CPU, memory, and peripherals.

35. **What is a front-side bus (FSB)?**
    The FSB connects the CPU to the northbridge chipset, managing communication with the memory and other high-speed components.

36. **What is a back-side bus (BSB)?**
    The BSB connects the CPU to the L2 cache, facilitating faster access to frequently used data.

37. **What is a northbridge?**
    The northbridge chipset handles communication between the CPU, RAM, and graphics card, managing high-speed interactions.

38. **What is a southbridge?**
    The southbridge chipset manages communication with slower peripherals such as hard drives, USB ports, and audio devices.

39. **What is a system on a chip (SoC)?**
    An SoC integrates all or most components of a computer system onto a single integrated circuit, optimizing space and power efficiency.

40. **What is Amdahl's Law?**
    Amdahl's Law states that the potential speedup of a program using multiple processors is limited by the portion of the program that cannot be parallelized, highlighting diminishing returns.
