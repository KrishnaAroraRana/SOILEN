5. **What is a hypervisor?**
   A hypervisor is software that creates and manages virtual machines by partitioning hardware resources.

6. **What is process scheduling?**
   Process scheduling is the method by which an operating system allocates CPU time to various processes.

7. **What is a context switch?**
   A context switch is the process of saving the state of a running process and restoring the state of another process.

8. **What is deadlock?**
   Deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for resources held by the other(s).

9. **What is a file permission?**
   File permissions are settings that determine who can read, write, or execute a file in an operating system.

10. **What is a system call?**
    A system call is a mechanism by which a program requests a service from the operating system's kernel.

11. **What is a swap file?**
    A swap file is a file on a disk used by the operating system to simulate additional RAM by temporarily storing inactive memory pages.

12. **What is load balancing?**
    Load balancing is the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources to optimize resource use and avoid overloading.

13. **What is a patch management system?**
    A patch management system is a process for acquiring, testing, and installing patches (updates) to software and systems.

14. **What is an emulator?**
    An emulator is software that enables one computer system to behave like another, allowing software designed for one system to run on another.

15. **What is system monitoring?**
    System monitoring involves tracking the performance and activities of a computer system to ensure it is operating efficiently and securely.

16. **What is a rollback?**
